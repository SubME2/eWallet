## Features

This E-Wallet application provides core functionalities for managing digital funds:

  * **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration, login, and role-based access control using Spring Security and JWT.
  * **Core Wallet Operations:**
      * **Deposits:** Add funds to a user's wallet.
      * **Withdrawals:** Remove funds from a user's wallet.
      * **Transfers:** Seamlessly transfer funds between registered users' wallets.
  * **Idempotency:** Ensures that retried financial transaction requests do not lead to duplicate processing, guaranteeing reliable operations even in case of network issues.
  * **Optimistic Locking:** Prevents concurrent update anomalies on wallet balances, maintaining data consistency. Operations are automatically retried upon detected conflicts.
  * **Comprehensive Ledger System:** Maintains an immutable, detailed record of every balance change for each wallet (`LedgerEntry`), providing robust auditing capabilities with pre/post transaction balances, linked transaction IDs, and related party information.
  * **Transactional Integrity:** All financial operations are wrapped in database transactions to guarantee atomicity and consistency.
  * **Auditing:** Automatic timestamping for creation and last modification of entities, supplementing the detailed ledger entries for complete audit trails.

## Architectural Highlights

The project is built with a focus on enterprise-grade reliability and scalability:

  * **Non-Blocking Asynchronous RESTful API Design:** Leverages modern reactive programming principles within Spring Boot to handle a high volume of concurrent requests efficiently without blocking server threads, enhancing responsiveness and scalability.
  * **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns into Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
  * **Spring Boot:** Rapid application development with convention over configuration.
  * **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions and provides powerful repository abstractions.
  * **Spring Security:** Robust authentication and authorization framework.
  * **PostgreSQL Database:** A reliable, open-source relational database.

## Technologies Used

  * **Backend:**
      * Java 17+
      * Spring Boot 3.x
      * Spring WebFlux (for non-blocking API)
      * Spring Data R2DBC (for reactive database access, if applicable, or traditional Spring Data JPA with a reactive wrapper/thread pool)
      * Spring Security (with JWT)
      * Lombok
  * **Database:**
      * PostgreSQL
  * **Build Tool:**
      * Maven
  * **Testing:**
      * JUnit 5
      * Mockito
      * AssertJ
      * Testcontainers (for isolated integration tests with real PostgreSQL instances)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the E-Wallet application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
  * Maven 3.6.0 or higher
  * Docker (for running PostgreSQL with Testcontainers during development/testing, or a local PostgreSQL instance)
  * A PostgreSQL database (if not using Docker/Testcontainers)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-wallet-app.git
    cd e-wallet-app
    ```

2.  **Configure PostgreSQL:**

      * **Option A: Using Docker (Recommended for local development/testing)**
        Ensure Docker is running. The application's test environment is pre-configured to use Testcontainers, which will automatically start a PostgreSQL container for tests. For development, you might want a persistent container:
        ```bash
        docker run --name ewallet-postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=ewallet_db -e POSTGRES_USER=ewallet_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ewallet_pass -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:16-alpine
        ```
      * **Option B: Local PostgreSQL Installation**
        Ensure you have a PostgreSQL instance running. Create a database (e.g., `ewallet_db`) and a user (e.g., `ewallet_user` with password `ewallet_pass`). Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your database connection details:
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ewallet_db
        spring.datasource.username=ewallet_user
        spring.datasource.password=ewallet_pass
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Or validate for production
        ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the Spring Boot application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

The API is built as a non-blocking asynchronous RESTful service.

**Authentication:**

  * `POST /api/auth/register`
  * `POST /api/auth/login`

**Wallet Operations (Requires Authentication):**

  * `GET /api/wallet/balance`
  * `POST /api/wallet/deposit` (Requires `amount` and `idempotencyKey` in request body)
  * `POST /api/wallet/withdraw` (Requires `amount` and `idempotencyKey` in request body)
  * `POST /api/wallet/transfer` (Requires `receiverUsername`, `amount`, and `idempotencyKey` in request body)

**Ledger/History (Requires Authentication):**

  * `GET /api/ledger/entries` (Get all ledger entries for the current user's wallet)
  * `GET /api/ledger/entries/range?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD` (Get ledger entries within a date range)
  * `GET /api/ledger/entries/summary/daily?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD` (Get daily summarized ledger entries within a date range)

*Detailed request/response bodies and examples can be found in the project's Postman collection or API documentation (if available).*

## Security

  * **JWT-based Authentication:** Securely authenticates users and authorizes access to protected resources.
  * **Password Hashing:** User passwords are encrypted using strong hashing algorithms.
  * **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiates user permissions (e.g., `ROLE_USER`).
  * **Idempotency & Optimistic Locking:** Crucial for financial security and data integrity under concurrent access.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

  * **Unit Tests:** For individual components (services, repositories).
  * **Integration Tests:**
      * Verifies the interaction between layers (services, repositories, database).
      * Utilizes **Testcontainers** to spin up isolated PostgreSQL instances for each test run, ensuring a clean and consistent testing environment.
      * Includes specific **concurrency tests** to validate the optimistic locking and idempotency mechanisms under simulated high load.

To run all tests:

```bash
mvn clean test
```
